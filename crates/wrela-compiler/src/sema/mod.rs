//! Semantic checking: `syntax::ast::Module -> ()` (a diagnostic) or the
//! `check` stage's dump. Normative source: docs/language/, chiefly
//! §2-§8 (02-language.md). Shape frozen by plans/M2.md:
//!
//! - One file per pass (decision 10), in the frozen pass order (decision
//!   3): collect + resolve (symbols.rs) -> declare (types.rs) -> bodies
//!   (bodies.rs) -> access (access.rs) -> flow (flow.rs, storage paths
//!   shared with paths.rs) -> matches (matches.rs) -> generics
//!   (generics.rs). Every file exists from item A onward, stubbed until
//!   its own item lands, so later items land in their own file rather
//!   than growing this one.
//! - One diagnostic shape throughout (decision 1): `error[<category>]:
//!   <message> at <line>:<col>`, fail-fast — the first error in pass
//!   order, source order within a pass.
//! - A fail-closed helper (decision 7) any pass can reuse: a reachable
//!   construct sema does not check yet reports `error[unimplemented]:
//!   <what> is not checked yet at L:C` instead of silently accepting it.
//!
//! Item A lands collect + resolve and the builtin prelude (prelude.rs);
//! every later pass is a stub (a no-op) until its own item lands, so
//! `check` below only calls what item A actually implements.
